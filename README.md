This is where my work projects are stored


I am a driven young professional exploring a developing career in data science and analysis. As the world of data grows exponentially, I aspire to apply and expand my technical skills to organize and visualize it in coherent and cohesive ways. I hope that my skills will help companies and individuals make sense of large data and apply their knowledge and skills to make meaningful differences in society and this world.

What you will see in this portfolio are projects I have used for work. Some of the lines have been redacted due to the confidentiality of my work. These projects capture my skills in data cleaning, visualization, natural language processing, and I am excited to learn and apply more into future projects.

All of these projects were developed in python.

Sincerely,

Harold Lee
