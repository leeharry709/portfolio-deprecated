This is where my projects are stored


I am a driven young professional exploring a developing career in data science and analytics. As the world of data grows exponentially, I aspire to apply and expand my technical skills to organize and visualize it in coherent and cohesive ways. I hope that my skills will help companies and individuals make sense of large data and apply their knowledge and skills to make meaningful differences in society and this world.

What you will see in this portfolio are some projects I have used for work as well as for my own personal development. Some of the lines have been redacted due to the confidentiality of my work, but they do not detract from the overall function of it. 


Skills Compiler.py reads through job descriptions from my current company and brings out the KSAs (knowledge, skills, and abilites) into a text file. This is to be used in conjunction with Text Analyzer - Word Cloud.py, which then uses natural language processing to compile the most commonly appearing words and bigrams and displays it on a word cloud.

Ripe mango detector.py is a machine learning project that trains a model to be able to predict if the user submitted mango image is ripe or not. For more information on this project, visit https://github.com/leeharry709/ripe-mango-detector. This repository has more details regarding the project and the process of creating the code as well as all the supplemental files.

Sentiment analyzer.py uses natural language processing and collects words from a text file, and if it attributes to a listed emotion, the emotion counter for that emotion goes up. After analyzing the full text document, it will display a histogram of all the emotions in the text file. It is used in conjunction with get tweets.py, which gets tweets based on a text query and puts it all in a txt.file


These projects capture my skills in data cleaning, visualization, natural language processing, machine learning, and I am excited to learn and apply more technical skills into future projects.


Sincerely,

Harold Lee
